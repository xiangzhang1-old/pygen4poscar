#Idea
The script is based on the notion of:
 - modules [ changeable_keyword, nonchangeable_keyword, customized_keyword, othercustomized_keyword ]
 - completeness: in each module, all publevel keywords are compulsorily set by hand, or defaulted to the mandatory value. if something goes unset, you'll definitely know
 - explicit self-consistency: no overwriting is ever allowed. nonchangeable keyword values are fixed, and changeable keyword values cannot be rewritten. if conflicts arrise, you'll definitely now
 - partial logical self-consistency: some logical errors (i.e. isnotmetal+ismetal,hse06+isym=2) is checked
 - portability: through gen.conf.modules,gen.conf.cust,gen.con.othercust,gen.conf.opt_man_modules,gen.conf.kwban,gen.conf.kwnullify, you get to establish, with ease and from scratch/newbie, a module-based command-line quantumchem-input-file-establishing system. Any of them!

#Module-based implementation

#Data structure
Associative arrays
- modnames={modname:1}  #flags   #mod "virtual" collects ckw's and nckw's from cust and othercust. note that module "virtual"'s kw's values are not used at all. only names are used.
- modules={generic_ckw:{kpoints:placeholder}} ->
  - xxx_ckw: changeable keywords: are necessary in module, but value changeable, therefore read or overwritten by nckw. still, empty at the start
  - xxx_nckw: nonchangeable_keyword and value: are necessary in module, and value fixed
- keywords = {$kwname:$kwval}   
  - all keywords ARE REAL TYPES (lists etc)
  - kwval read from conf.* & argval read from stdin, AFTER BASH PASSING & PRINTING, SHOULD STILL BE PYTHON_READABLE (augmented_python_format, \"dperovskite\" rather than "dperovskite" for command-line, and "dperovskite" for files)
  - on the other hand, all kwnames/modnames read from stdin, AFTER BASH PASSING, SHOULD STILL BE PYTHON_READABLE (plain_for_string, nions rather than 'nions' for stdin/files)
- ullifiedkw = {kwname:$kwval}    #effective after keyword nullifying takes place

Files:
gen.conf.modules        =>  module infrastructure (& with cust,othercust...)    =>  $modname:$nckwname:$ckwname
gen.conf.cust           =>  customized keywords if modules $ifyes are present   =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$nckwname=$nckwval;...:$ckwname:1/0   #1 if must, 0 if recommended. 1 comes first!
gen.conf.othercust      =>  script-customized kws if modules $ifyes are present =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$nckwname:$batchname;...              #$batchname is run if $ifyes !$ifnot
..opt_mand_modules      =>  customizable optional mandatory modules             =>  $sum_act_mod_number1;...:$modname1;...              #active mods summed equals $sum_act_1 or ...
----
[1] for othercust, nckw means 'keywords whose values must be dictated by othercust' and ckw means 'keywords whose values will be determined as non-zero but can be changed by anyone
[2] note that ';' rather than ',' is used to separate items. this is because python uses ',' in lists
[3] note that None <-> not-defined, '' can be defined (like empty list)


#Additional feature
gen.conf.kwban          =>  ban certain value of keywords (or kws) if $ifyes    =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$kwban_kw=$kwban_kwval:$kwban_kw
gen.conf.kwnullify      =>  nullify certain kw if $ifyes !$ifnot                =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$kwnullify
gen.conf.check          =>  perform non-complete syntax&semantic check          =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$batchname,...                        #$batchname is run if $ifyes !$ifnot
gen.conf.postcheck      =>  check after KPOINTS/INCAR/POTCAR writing            =>  $ifyes:$ifnot:$batchname,...                        #$batchname is run if $ifyes !$ifnot

#Usage
gen [modname] [kwname] [kwval]
